# tool-builds

Continually build the tools and images that I rely on that do not have packages available. These feed into my working Containerfiles that are found at [cheesesashimi/containerfiles](https://github.com/cheesesashimi/containerfiles).

The difference between these two repos is the purpose and intent of the Containerfiles that are produced. These are produced to be inputs into the Containerfiles present in the other repository.
